## **Pet Store Shopping System**

This program simulates a simple pet store shopping system.

It consists of **two classes**:
- **PetItem**: Represents a pet item with attributes such as title, cost, and count.
- **Basket**: Represents a basket that allows users to add, remove, and view pet items.

**The Basket class** includes methods for managing the shopping basket:
- add_to_basket: Adds a specified quantity of an item to the basket or updates the quantity if the item is already present.
- remove_from_basket: Removes a specified quantity of an item from the basket or removes the item entirely.
- view_basket: Displays the contents of the shopping basket and calculates the total cost.
- display_available_items: Displays a list of available pet items for users to choose from.

**The program provides a sample usage section where users can interact with the shopping basket through a menu:**
1. Add item to basket
2. Remove an item from a basket
3. View basket
4. Checkout and exit

Users can select options, input item quantities, and manage their shopping basket until they choose to checkout and exit the program.

_This program is designed to showcase a basic understanding of classes, methods, user input handling, and simple interaction with a shopping basket system._
